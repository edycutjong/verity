# Contributing to Verity

Thanks for your interest in **Verity** — real-world-asset reputation oracles
bonded to accuracy, where an oracle's reputation bleeds when it's wrong. This
project was built for the Casper Agentic Buildathon and is developed in the
open. Bug reports, ideas, and pull requests are all welcome.

## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the [Contributor Covenant](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By
participating, you are expected to uphold it. Report unacceptable behavior to
**edy.cu@live.com**.

## Tech Stack

- **App:** Next.js 16 (App Router) · React 19 · TypeScript · Tailwind CSS 4
- **Smart contract:** Rust + [Odra](https://odra.dev) 2.x, deployed to Casper Testnet
- **Oracle:** EWMA accuracy reputation · x402 pay-per-query settlement
- **Tooling:** Node 22 · pnpm 10 · Rust nightly + cargo-odra · Vitest · Playwright

## Getting Started

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # the app runs in Demo Mode by default (no keys needed)
pnpm dev                     # http://localhost:3000
```

## Development Workflow

Before opening a pull request, make sure the local gate is green:

```bash
pnpm typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
pnpm lint         # eslint
pnpm test         # vitest
pnpm build        # next build
```

Smart-contract changes (Rust / Odra):

```bash
cd contract && cargo test
```

See [`LIVE_TESTNET.md`](LIVE_TESTNET.md) for wiring the app to a live Casper
Testnet contract, and [`deployments/testnet.json`](deployments/testnet.json) for
the deployed package hash and sample transactions.
